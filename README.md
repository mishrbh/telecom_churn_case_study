# telecom_churn_case_study
Customers usually do not decide to switch to another competitor instantly, but rather over a period (this is especially applicable to high-value customers). In churn prediction, we assume that there are three phases of the customer lifecycle-
The ‘good’ phase: In this phase, the customer is happy with the service and behaves as usual.
The ‘action’ phase: The customer experience starts to sore in this phase, for e.g. he/she gets a compelling offer from a competitor, faces unjust charges, becomes unhappy with service quality etc. In this phase, the customer usually shows different behaviour than in the ‘good’ months. Also, it is crucial to identify high-churn-risk customers in this phase, since some corrective actions can be taken at this point (such as matching the competitor’s offer/improving the service quality etc.)
The ‘churn’ phase: In this phase, the customer is said to have churned.

As prescribed by the user, onboarding new customers are expensive than retaining. Hence, predicting potential churning customers are of upmost importance.
However, it makes more sense to focus on valuable customers. These are the customers who generate revenue  for the company frequently.
